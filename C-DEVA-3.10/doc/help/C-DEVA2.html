<h2>C-DEVA Operation Steps：</h2>
<h3>1，Reading protein network with a text file：</h3>
<strong>(1)_Read the original network</strong><br/>
    File format：<img src="images/1.jpg" width="140" height="214" alt="file format" /><br/>
After reading the file
<p><img src="images/2.jpg" width="540" height="350" /></p>
We can check the network graph：<br/>

<strong>(2)Read the file which the system outputs</strong><br/>
File format<img src="images/12.jpg" width="269" height="351" /><br/>
<h3>2,Identify the functional modules with the clustering algorithms</h3>
Choose the algorithm：choose the menu "Algorithm"：<br/>
<p><img src="images/4.jpg" width="296" height="199" /></p>
Choose a algorithm and run：if the algorithm needs several paramaters then there will be a setting dialog：<br/>
<p><img src="images/5.jpg" width="212" height="109" /></p>
After setting the paramaters then click the button "confirm" to analysis the network,the result is shown as following picture：<br/>
We use tree to show the results,when we click any tree node we can check the functional module：<br/>
<p><img src="images/6.jpg" alt="" width="679" height="494" /></p>
There is another way to display the results,which show the overlap among the complexes,we can check the results with the operations just as the following pictures：<br/>
<p><img src="images/7.jpg" width="381" height="247" /> </p>
Choose the menu "Show Overla" then we can check the overlap among the complexes：<br/>
<p><img src="images/8.jpg" width="518" height="314" /> </p>
As there are no overlaps among the complexes which the algorithm FAG-EC identify.so we can see no neighbour of the node as follows。
<h3>(3)The implements of the evaluation</h3>
After identifying the function modules,then we can evaluate the results with the evaluation plug-ins。<br/>
<p><img src="images/9.jpg" width="367" height="193" /></p>
Now there are three evaluation plug-ins in this system：。Here we set the "Basic Information" plug-in as the example。<br/>
<p><img src="images/10.jpg" width="987" height="643" /> </p>
The red area is a control panel,the blue area is also a control panel that the system offers。<br/>
If we choose to evaluate the density of the complexes.<br/>
