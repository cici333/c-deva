<h1>C-DEVA</h1>
 <span class="STYLE5">Clustering in protein interaction network is an important means for the identification of functional modules, which not only helps to understand the organization of biological systems, but also is of great significance to predict protein function. According to the fact that the clustering algorithms of protein interaction network are lack of effective analysis software, we design and implement a new analysis platform, which is named C-DEVA. C-DEVA is a scalable platform, in which a series of evaluation methods, such as recall, precision, sensitivity, specificity, p-value, and function enrichment, are implemented. Moreover, nine clustering algorithms MCODE, Coach, Monet, DPClus, FAG-EC, HC-PIN, IPC-MCE, IPCIPG-o, IPCIPG-n are developed in this platform. Even more important, not only the clustering results are visualized, but also the comparison results of multiple algorithms can be shown in this platform. This platform has a good scalability for the clustering algorithms and evaluation methods are implemented as plug-ins. </span>
